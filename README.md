# Latex Workflow
This is a parent repo for my latex workflow. It prevents you from having to upload the PDF to GitHub, and uses GitHub Actions to build & host the PDF.

# Usage
1. Clone this repo, and retitle to `<PROJECT_NAME>`.
2. Place `.tex` (and related files) in the `tex` folder.
3. Update entire `README.md` to
```
# <PROJECT_NAME>
Project description.

## ðŸ“„ Compiled PDF
[View compiled PDF](https://clarkmiyamoto.github.io/<PROJECT_NAME>/main.pdf)
```
4. Add, commit, and push.
